# Bottom-hole_Pressure-BHP-_Prediction_by_ANN

This workflow has been developed for bottom-hole pressure (BP) prediction when the BHP points are missing. 

The prediction of missing BHP values is indispensable as the BHP constraint model is closely associated with the correctness and integrity of BHP data records.

The workflow distribution consists with two parts:

                         -Data Pre-processing
                         -Artificial neural netowrk (ANN) model for the BHP prediction

Once the BHP points have been successfully predicted, they will be fed into the reservoir simulation model for the following field/well level history matching.
